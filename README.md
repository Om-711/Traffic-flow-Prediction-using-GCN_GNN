# Traffic-flow-Prediction-using-GCN_GNN

This project focuses on **predicting traffic flow** using **Graph Convolutional Networks (GCN)** and **Graph Neural Networks (GNN)**. We leverage publicly available traffic datasets to build spatiotemporal models that capture the complex relationships between traffic sensors over time and space.

## ðŸš¦ Overview

Urban traffic forecasting is a key problem in intelligent transportation systems. Traditional models struggle to handle spatial dependencies across a traffic network. In this project, we address this challenge by:

- Representing road networks as graphs
- Modeling temporal patterns using sequence models (like GRU)
- Capturing spatial dependencies with GCN/GNN layers

## ðŸ“‚ Datasets Used

We use two widely-used benchmark datasets provided by the [California Department of Transportation (Caltrans)](http://pems.dot.ca.gov/):

| Model | Dataset | Nodes | Time Steps | Time Interval |
|-------|---------|-------|-------------|----------------|
| GNN   | [PeMSD4](https://github.com/liyaguang/DCRNN/tree/master/data) | 307   | 13824 (59 days) | 5 minutes |
| GCN   | [PeMSD8](https://github.com/liyaguang/DCRNN/tree/master/data) | 170   | 17856 (69 days) | 5 minutes |

> Both datasets include speed/flow data and pre-computed adjacency matrices.
